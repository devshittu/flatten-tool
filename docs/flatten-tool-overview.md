# Flatten Tool: Simplifying Codebase Consolidation

## Summary

The Flatten Tool is a powerful command-line utility designed to consolidate project files into a single file with descriptive paths, streamlining code sharing, documentation, and analysis for Python and JavaScript projects on Unix/Linux. With features like auto-detection of files and directories, wildcard pattern support, one-depth import inclusion, and multiple output formats (txt, md, json), it offers a flexible and efficient solution for developers. Its modular Python package design, plugin system, and parallel processing ensure extensibility and performance, making it an essential tool for modern development workflows.

## Introduction

In software development, consolidating a project's codebase into a single, readable file can be invaluable for tasks like code review, documentation, or sharing with AI models like Grok or ChatGPT for analysis. However, manually combining files while preserving context (e.g., file paths) is tedious and error-prone. The Flatten Tool addresses this by automating the process with a robust CLI, offering intuitive commands and advanced features tailored for Python and JavaScript projects.

## Key Features

### Auto-Detection of Files and Directories

The tool intelligently distinguishes between files and directories based on path syntax:

- **Files**: Paths like `./src/file.js` or `readme.md` are treated as individual files.
- **Directories**: Paths like `./src/`, `.`, or `./` indicate directories, with optional recursive processing via the `--recursive` flag.

This eliminates the need for separate commands, making usage intuitive:

```bash
flatten ./src/components/Button.tsx  # Flatten a single file
flatten ./src/ --recursive         # Flatten a directory recursively
```

### Wildcard Pattern Support

Developers can target specific files across directories using wildcard patterns:

```bash
flatten **/readme.md --recursive
```

This command flattens all `readme.md` files in the project, ideal for aggregating documentation.

### One-Depth Import Inclusion

The `--with-imports` flag includes one-depth dependencies (imports/requires) for a file, ensuring relevant code is captured:

```bash
flatten ./src/components/Button.tsx --with-imports
```

This is particularly useful for sharing self-contained code snippets with LLMs or colleagues.

### Multiple Output Formats

The tool supports three output formats:

- **Text (**`txt`**)**: Simple, with file paths as comments.
- **Markdown (**`md`**)**: Structured for documentation.
- **JSON (**`json`**)**: Machine-readable for integration with other tools.

Example markdown output:

```markdown
## File: ./src/index.js
console.log("Hello, world!");
## File: ./src/index.js
```

### Modular and Extensible Design

Built as a Python package, the tool is split into modules (`cli`, `config`, `file_handler`, `output`, `logging`) for maintainability. A plugin system allows custom import parsers:

```python
# plugins/my_parser.py
def parse_imports(content, file_path):
    return re.findall(r'custom_import\s+[\'"](.+?)[\'"]', content)
```

### Performance and Usability

- **Parallel Processing**: Uses `multiprocessing` to process files concurrently.
- **Interactive Setup**: The `flatten init` command guides users through configuration.
- **Error Handling**: Generates detailed error reports in `.flatten/output/errors/`.
- **Colorized Logging**: Uses `colorama` for clear terminal output.

## Use Cases

1. **Code Sharing**: Share a consolidated codebase with colleagues or LLMs for review or debugging.
2. **Documentation**: Generate a single markdown file for project documentation.
3. **Analysis**: Prepare code for static analysis tools requiring a single input file.
4. **Education**: Create comprehensive code examples for teaching or presentations.

## Getting Started

1. **Install**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/flatten-tool.git
   cd flatten-tool
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   pip3 install tqdm colorama jsonschema pytest
   ```

2. **Initialize**:

   ```bash
   flatten init
   ```

3. **Flatten Files**:

   ```bash
   flatten ./src/ --recursive -o project.md
   ```

4. **Explore**:

   ```bash
   flatten help
   flatten examples
   ```

## Contributing

The Flatten Tool is open-source and community-driven. Contributions are welcome via:

- **Bug Reports**: Report issues on GitHub.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest enhancements.
- **Pull Requests**: Add features, plugins, or documentation.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for details. Notably, sharing code with LLMs like Grok can accelerate developmentâ€”ensure you provide context and validate outputs.

## Future Directions

- **More Plugins**: Support for additional languages (e.g., Go, Rust).
- **GUI Interface**: A desktop app for non-CLI users.
- **Cloud Integration**: Upload flattened files to cloud storage.
- **Advanced Import Resolution**: Multi-depth dependency inclusion.

## Conclusion

The Flatten Tool simplifies codebase consolidation with a developer-friendly CLI, robust features, and an extensible architecture. Whether you're preparing code for AI analysis, documentation, or collaboration, it streamlines the process while maintaining flexibility. Join the community to enhance this tool and make it a staple in every developer's toolkit.
