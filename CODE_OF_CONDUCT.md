# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the Flatten Tool project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces, such as conferences or social media.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via GitHub Issues or by emailing `<devshittu@gmail.com>` (replace with your email). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: A private, written warning detailing the behavior and an opportunity to correct it.
2. **Warning**: A public or private warning with a specified duration for behavior adjustment.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from project interaction, such as commenting or submitting PRs.
